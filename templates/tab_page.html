                <p>In guitar tablature each number thats annoted on the string represents the area of the fretboard that you play it on. <br><br>
                   The numbers on a piece of tablature represent the fret numbers you will press down. Single numbers from left to right <br><br>
                   are single note melodies. Numbers stacked vertally are called <b> chords</b>. Chords are notes played simultaneously.</p>

                <h4>Part 2: Standard Music vs Tablature</h4>
                <img src="https://guitarlessons-com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog/tab-basic-layout.png" alt="tab_image" height="350" width="500"><br>
                <p>Tablature is annoted differently from standard music notion. Notice that there are only 5 lines in Standard music <br><br>
                   but 6 lines in Tablature. The difference between the two is the fact that tab uses numbers to mark notes and standard<br><br>
                   uses symbols as notes. The numbers on the side represent the number of guitar strings and the name of each string.</p>

                <p>There are usually 22-24 frets on each guitar. One thing you should know is that the fretboat notes start over after the<br><br>
                12th fret. <b>Reminder!</b> the 6th strings is also called the <b>Low E</b> and the 1st string is called the <b>High E string</b>. The letters<br><br>
                next to the numbers are the names of each string on the guitar. This letter combination is known as standard E tuning.</p>

                <p>Single notes in guitar tab are offset and played separately, while chords are notes that are played<br><br>
                simultaneously (think strumming all 6 string). The 0 represents an <b>Open</b> note, meaning you play the string<br><br>
                with out pressing down on the string. Almost all tabs have open notes in them, whether in chords or singular.</p>

                <p>Scales in Tablature are represented as a sequence of notes. A Scales that starts at the <b>Low E</b> string <br><br>
                 and ends at the <b>High E</b> is called a <b>Descending</b> scale. A Scale that starts from the <b>High E</b> and works<br><br>
                 up is called an <b>Ascending</b> scale. There are many different scales and modes represented in guitar tablature.</p>
