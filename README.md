A simple web application to teach guitar tablature
Goal:
I wanted an application that was a quick and easy way to learn a concept that is often overcomplicated by competing webpages. By adding a quiz and also allowingÂ feedback, I allow the user to check their progress and to quickly return to the material they are unsure about.
